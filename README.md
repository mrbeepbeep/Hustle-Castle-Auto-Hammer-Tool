Overview

A simple and lightweight tool for collecting rewards in the Hustle Castle Game Hammer event. No install necessary, just one file required.  

Instructions:

1) Navigate to the Hammer Event 'Game' page.

2) Run script, and press start (or F1 key)

Notes:

* The tool will collect all rewards and providing the special item to refresh the map is obtained with the special reward the field will be refreshed. 

* There is nothing the script can possibly do to misclick in an undedesired area, if there are no hammers left the script wont do anything.

* Please report any issues on the youtube demonstration video, or feature requests.

* In future hammer events the file will require slight adjustments to suit the field animations (current event at April 2025 is barrel animations). Please ensure you download the updated file
